# z-flipper
A plugin for Figma to make the layer order of an Auto Layout match how it's children are actually arranged, instead of flipped. This plugin applies the 180/180 rotation trick as first described to me by this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/annafunk/status/1497027646152069123?s=20&t=mQPClFGHtI1YaHRdLlrtOA).
